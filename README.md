#🔐 QKD Information Reconciliation using LDPC Codes
This project demonstrates LDPC-based Error Correction used in Quantum Key Distribution (BB84).

🚀 What This Project Does

• Generates a random "Alice" key
• Simulates noise (bit flips) for "Bob"
• Builds an LDPC matrix (Gallager-style)
• Computes syndrome
• Runs bit-flip decoder
• Recovers the key
• Prints statistics

This is a full working simulation of QKD reconciliation.
