🔐 QKD Information Reconciliation using LDPC Codes

This project demonstrates LDPC-based Error Correction used in Quantum Key Distribution (BB84).

🚀 What This Project Does

Generates a random "Alice" key

Simulates noise (bit flips) for "Bob"

Builds an LDPC matrix (Gallager-style)

Computes syndrome

Runs bit-flip decoder

Recovers the key

Prints statistics

This is a full working simulation of QKD reconciliation.
